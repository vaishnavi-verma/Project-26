# How to make Chocolate Souffle ? 

1. Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 375 degrees F.
   Lightly coat two 10-ounce ramekins with cooking spray; coat the insides of each with 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar.
2. Place chocolate in a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on Medium, 
   stirring every 20 seconds, until melted, 1 to 2 minutes.
3. Whisk egg yolk and cream in a medium bowl until combined. Whisk in 
   the chocolate until smooth, then whisk in flour and cinnamon until incorporated.
4. Beat egg whites and salt in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on 
   high speed until soft peaks form. Beat in the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar in four additions, until stiff, glossy peaks form.
5. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold half the beaten whites into the 
   chocolate mixture until fairly smooth; then gently fold this combined mixture back into the remaining egg whites until no white streaks remain. Divide between the prepared ramekins and place on a baking sheet. Bake until puffed and firm to the touch, 18 to 22 minutes. Dust with confectioners' sugar, if desired. Serve immediately.
